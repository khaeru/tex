# Packages, modules and other tools for LaTeX and friends

- `logo`: logos. Use `make` in the top level to generate PDFs from SVGs and EPS files.
- `mf`: submodules for fast-moving packages and others I maintain, including:
  - [`mitthesis` class](https://github.com/khaeru/mitthesis)
  - [`trbunofficial` class](https://github.com/khaeru/trb-latex)

# Packages (`.sty`)

- `beamerthememitidss.sty`—a Beamer theme with the [MIT IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu) logo and colours.
- `unicode-extra.sty`—define more Unicode characters for use with `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`. The goal is that most characters produced with compose key sequences on Ubuntu should be valid in LaTeX sources.
