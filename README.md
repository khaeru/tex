# Packages, modules and other tools for LaTeX and friends

- `logo`: logos. Use `make` in the top level to generate PDFs from SVGs and EPS files.
- Submodules for personal packages, forks, etc.:
  - [`iiasa` Beamer theme](https://github.com/iiasa/beamer-theme-iiasa)
  - [`mitthesis` class](https://github.com/khaeru/mitthesis)
  - [`trbunofficial` class](https://github.com/khaeru/trb-latex)
- Submodules for fast-moving packages, including `gitinfo2`, `mtheme`, and `pgfplots`.

## Packages (`.sty`)

- `beamerthememitidss.sty`: a Beamer theme with the [MIT IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu) logo and colours.
- `unicode-extra.sty`: define more Unicode characters for use with `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`.
  The goal is that most characters produced with compose key sequences on Ubuntu should be valid in LaTeX sources.
