pgfplots - Create normal/logarithmic plots in two and three dimensions for LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.

pgfplotstable - Loads, rounds, formats and postprocesses numerical tables.

PGFPlots draws high--quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling
with a user-friendly interface directly in TeX. The user supplies axis labels,
legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and PGFPlots
applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the
plots. It supports line plots, scatter plots, piecewise constant plots, bar
plots, area plots, mesh-- and surface plots, patch plots, contour plots, quiver
plots, histogram plots, polar axes, ternary diagrams, smith charts and some
more.

Pgfplots is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ (pgf).

Pgfplotstable displays numerical tables rounded to desired precision in various
display formats, for example scientific format, fixed point format or integer,
using TeX's math facilities for pretty printing. Furthermore, it provides
methods for table postprocessing.

  doc/latex/pgfplots/pgfplots.pdf
and

HISTORY:
post 1.9 (DEV):
- fixed bug: xelatex failed to run contour external

1.9:
- new feature: asymmetric error bars
- new feature: activated math parser for axis limit arguments, arguments in axis cs, and domain argument in log plots
- new feature: stacked bar plots place their 'nodes near coords' correctly in the middle and print the increment (compat=1.9)
- new feature: stacked bar plots suppress empty increments (compat=1.9).
- new feature: 'scatter/position=relative|absolute' allow to position 'nodes near coords' absolutely.
   use-case: bar plots + nodes near coords which are at, say, y=0 rather than their y value
- new feature: integration of smooth shadings & auto-CMYK conversion
    \usepackage[cmyk]{xcolor} or \selectcolormodel{cmyk} will reconfigure pgfplots to use CMYK (document-wide)
- new feature (advanced audience only): programmatic access to data coordinates during the visualization phase
	-> allows much more customization for error bars, stacked plots, nodes near coords.
- wrote beginner tutorials
- fixed bug: error bars and point meta did not work together
- fixed bug: stacked plots did not respect 'visualization depends on'
- fixed bug: luatex 0.76 is not backwards compatible; added version switch 
- fixed bug: ternary library precision has been improved
- fixed bug: problem with axis limits very close to 0
- fixed bug: colormap specification limit case produced out of bounds exception


1.8:
- new feature: tight bounding box even if the axis is no box and bb excludes clip path
- new feature: mesh/color input=explicit 
- new feature: shader=interp now has drivers for both dvipdfmx and xetex
- new feature: support for more color spaces in colormap definitions
- new feature: shader=interp and device-level gray colorspaces 
- new feature: 'contour/contour dir=[xyz]' to draw contours in different directions
- new feature: statistics library with boxplot handler (both boxplot prepared and automatic computation)
- fixed bug: 3d centered axis lines and label placement (requires compat=1.8 or higher)
- fixed bug: axis lines and placement of labels, tick scale labels, and reversed axes
    (requires compat=1.8 or higher)
- fixed bug: filtering out coords from a mesh plot failed
- fixed bug: every legend image post was not respected inside of \ref{plotlabel}
- fixed bug: high-order patches computed the shader=flat mean in a wrong way.
- fixed bug: remember picture inside of pgfplots axes failed (due to cell picture)
- fixed bug: now, the tick scale label will be omitted if there are no ticks
- fixed bug: axis box path was not closed
- fixed bug: the bounding box was non-empty even if the axis was hidden.
- fixed bug: auto-alignment of nodes near coords failed for xbar plots
- fixed bug: providing bar width / bar shift in terms of axis units did
    not work with [xy]bar and nodes near coords
- fixed bug: transformation 'data cs=cart' -> polar is more robust now
- fixed bug: code did not compile against pgf 2.00
- fixed bug: patch plot lib and shader=interp,patch type=biquadratic
- fixed bug: context path searching issue (pgfplots.lua)
- fixed bug: shader=interp and dvips driver 
- fixed bug: error bars with explicit relative input failed

1.7 
- added feature: 'bar shift' and 'bar width' can now be expressed in terms of axis units (compat=1.7 or higher)
- fixed incompatibility regression pgfplots 1.6.1 pgf 2.10: layers
- fixed incompatibility pgfplots and imakeidx
- added feature: 'enlargelimits={abs=1cm}', i.e. enlarge by dimension rather than unit
- patchplots lib: added patch type=bicubic
- patchplots lib: added support for global paths (fillable)
- patchplots lib: added patch type sampling feature
- patchplots lib: improved usability (documentation and improvements)
- fixed path issues in context: moved lua input file to tex/generic
- fixed bug: \ref{legendimage} inside of legend text was wrong.

1.6.1:
- fixed incompatibility lualatex,shader=interp, and german package (introduced in 1.6)

1.6:

- added support for second colormap in mesh plots (mesh/interior colormap name)
- added support for scopes inside of axes

- empty lines are interpreted as interruptions in data plots (was undocumented since 1.4)
- added more scaling options to 'scale mode=scale uniformly' (affects axis equal in 3d
  and \addplot3 graphics)
- fixed wrong implementation of 'axis equal' and 'unit vector ratio' in 3d
  (backwards compatible for 2d, but not for 3d - the 3d implementation was plain wrong)
