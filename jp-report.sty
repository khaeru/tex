% A package to mimic the JP Report LaTeX template, in LyX
% 2012-06-23 Paul Natsuo Kishimoto <pnk@MIT.EDU>
%
% This package is based on the files JP_report_formatting.tex and
% JP_Report_template.tex (v1.2, 2012-05-24) developed by Erwan Monier
% <emonier@MIT.EDU>.
%
% USAGE
%
% The following settings should be set in the LyX Document Settings dialog, with
% the remainder left at the LyX defaults. (If you have set global LyX defaults —
% for example, specific fonts — you will need to cancel or override them for
% this package to produce proper output.)
%
% * "Document class" page
%   * Document class: article
%   * Class options / Custom: fleqn
%     * This is an option for the 'amsmath' package, which LyX will load
%       automatically.
%   * Suppress default date on front page
% * "Modules" page
%   * Selected: "MIT Joint Program Report" module, included with this file as
%     jp-report.module. The file must be placed in the 'layout' subdirectory of
%     your LyX user directory (often '~/.lyx') to be available within LyX.
% * "Fonts" page
%   * Base Size: 12
% * "Bibliography" page
%   * Citation Style: Natbib
%   * Natbib Style: Author-year
%
% Prepare your JP Report in LyX as you would any other document, with only two
% exceptions:
%
% * In the Authors block, use LyX footnotes to indicate affiliations and the
%   corresponding author.
%   * After each footnote, insert a "protected space" by pressing Ctrl+Space.
%   * To reuse an affiliation (for example, if two authors are both JP
%     researchers), use the following LaTeX code in a code inset. Type Ctrl+L,
%     followed by "\thanksmark{1}". Use 2 for the second affiliation footnote,
%     etc. Also follow this mark with a protected space.
% * When inserting a BibTeX generated bibliography in the LyX document, use the
%   following options in the dialog:
%   * Style: click "Browse…" and choose the file jpreport.bst included with the
%     JP Report LaTeX Template, and also with this package.
%   * Add bibliography to ToC — NOT checked. This package handles adding it.
%
% TECHNICAL NOTES
%
% * The file is in four sections:
%   1. Package loads and package-related commands. Packages are loaded in
%      alphabetical order except where there are dependencies
%   2. Redefinitions of standard commands and environments
%   3. Unchanged content from JP_report_formatting.tex
%   4. LyX-specific commands
% * prettyref, as far as I can tell, does not provide a facility for making only
%   the *first* reference to each figure, table, etc. appear boldfaced. This
%   must be done manually in LyX, or extended through more advanced hacking here
%   or in jpreport.bst

%% 2. REDEFINITIONS OF STANDARD COMMANDS & ENVIRONMENTS

% In most instances simply \renewcommand\contentsname would be sufficient, but
% to comply with the JP Author's Guide it is necessary to remove vertical space
% at a couple of points. This could be done using the package 'tocloft', but
% using 'tocloft' and 'titletoc' simultaneously is difficult. This redefinition
% is very slightly modified from the one in the standard article.cls
\makeatletter
\renewcommand\tableofcontents{%
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}% remove space between the Abstract and ToC
  \small
  \begin{center}%
    {\bfseries \contentsname\vspace{-1em}}
  \end{center}%
  \@starttoc{toc}%
  }
\makeatother


%% 3. UNCHANGED CONTENT FROM JP_report_formatting.tex
% N.B. — the current version of jp-report.sty was developed for a JP Report that
% didn't make use of the following features. Using them within LyX may produce
% unexpected results.
