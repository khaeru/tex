Hi,

Welcome to the AIAA LaTeX bundle to help you produce AIAA
technical conference papers.

== Quick Start

Try typesetting sample.tex with the following sequence
of commands,

 pdflatex sample
 bibtex sample
 pdflatex sample
 pdflatex sample

The result should look like sample-eg.pdf.

== Troubleshooting

 ! LaTeX Error: File `hypernat.sty' not found.

you will need to obtain these missing packages from CTAN

answers to many other questions, see the UK TeX FAQ,
